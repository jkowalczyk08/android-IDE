# Code Editor for Android

## About
This is an IDE App for Android devices written in Flutter. The focus of the project was to create an IDE similar to the desktop IDEs we are used to, but one that is designed for smaller devices like smartphones and tablets.

## Features
In the app you can edit files and folders from your device's storage.

Once a folder is selected, you can browse it's contents in the Explorer section of the drawer menu. Tap a file to open it in the editor.

If you want to edit multiple files, you can change between them in the Open Editors section of the drawer menu. You can also close an editor by swiping left.

## Instalation

Download the .apk file from the latest release, open it on your android device, and follow the instructions on screen.
